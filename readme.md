Autonomy  Network

### Internet of Communities

Autonomy is a community owned network (CON) to decentralize your community.

Internet platforms of today are build by centralized organizations where value creators neither get substantial ownership nor governance rights.

Decentralized communities on the autonomy network can change this by issuing a community token on our blockchain infrastructure.
